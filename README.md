## Getting started


1) Install CUDA 11.8

Follow the instructions on https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive.

Make sure that

    PATH includes <CUDA_DIR>/bin
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes <CUDA_DIR>/lib64

The environment was tested only with this CUDA version.

2) Clone repo, download checkpoints and preprocessed example data:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Vanessik/Im2Haircut
cd Im2Haircut
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

## ðŸ§ª Try on Our Data


1. **Launch the demo:**

```bash
bash ./scripts/static.sh
```

2. Find results in the folder: ```./exps_inverse_stage/try/examples/{IMG_NAME}```


3. Visualize results using tensorbard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./exps_inverse_stage --port 6008
```


## ðŸ§© Try on Your Own Data

To run the pipeline on your own images, first download the model checkpoints and install all required submodules and environments:


```bash
chmod +x ./install_submodules.sh
./install_submodules.sh
```

Then follow these steps:

1. Place your input images in ```./data/new_data/img```

2. Compute preprocessing data (masks, orientation maps, depth maps, and cameras):
```bash
bash ./scripts/preprocess_any_data.sh
```

3) Run the main inference:
```bash
bash ./scripts/static.sh
```


ðŸ’» Code was tested on NVIDIA A100 GPU.
